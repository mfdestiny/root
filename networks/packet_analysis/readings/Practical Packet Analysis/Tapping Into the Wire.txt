To effectively analyze packets the physical location of sniffer placement is essential.
Depending on the size of the network you are analyzing this could be more difficult than the actual analysis. 
The hardware variety needs to be taken into account as well since different devices handle traffic in unique ways.


Sniffing Hubs

Hubs are an ideal set up but rare in the field due to the headaches it causes network administrators.
When multiple sources are communicating at the same time packet collisions will occur causing packets to be dropped. This loss causes potential network congestion 
depending on the protocol used (TCP/IP) as retransmitting could occur. As traffic increases and collisions increase network performance begins to suffer. Hence the
preference for switches over hubs. Most likely only find hubs on networks supporting legacy systems.

Sniffing Switches

The most common device used in modern networks unfortunately the complexity makes packet sniffing a bit more difficult but not impossible.
Connecting to a switch, the sniffer can only listen to broadcasted messages and packets transmitted and received from the connected device.

To capture additional data their are four primary methods:
1.  port mirroring
2.  hubbing out
3.  using a tap
4.  ARP cache poisoning
