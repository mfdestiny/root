.Address Resolution Protocol

When a device communicates via an application with another device the application should have the ability to build layers 3 through 7 assuming the IP address
is known via DNS. In order to continue down the stack the application needs the MAC address of the destination device. Switches have lookup tables called
CAM (Content Addressable Memory) tables which has the mac addresses of all the devices connected to its ports. 

When the switch receives traffic for one its devices it checks the table and forwards the data to the correct port. If the MAC address is unknown the transmitting 
device will check its cache and if still unknown additional communication is required to resolve the MAC address via the Address Resolution Protocol 
on ipv4 networks defined by RFC 826. The protocol uses only two packets an ARP request and an ARP response.

The ARP request simple is a broadcast to all devices in the network segment stating "Hi this is my IP1:MAC pair and I have data for IP2 however I do not know
their MAC address. Whoever has this IP2 address could you please give me your MAC address". Ideally IP2 responds with their MAC address while all other 
devices drop the packet/discard the request. The requesting device then updates its CAM table and continues the data transfer.

.ARP Packet Structure

The ARP header includes the following fields:
-Hardware Type : Layer 2 mostly used is Ethernet in this case. Could be fiber in the future.
-Protocol Type : Higher-level protocol for which the ARP request is being used 
-Hardware Address Length : The length in (octet/bytes) of the hardware address in use  (6 for ethernet)
-Protocol Address Length : "                          " of the logical address in use 
-Operation : Function of the packet; 1 being request and 2 being response
-Sender Address Length : Hardware address of the sender
-Sender Protocol Address  : Senders upper layer protocol address
-Target Address Length  : Intended receivers hardware address (all zeroes in ARP reqests)
-Target Protocol Address : Intended receivers upper-layer protocol address
