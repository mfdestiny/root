.Berkley Packet Filter (BPF)
 
 Filters using the BPF syntax are called expressions consisting of one or more primitives.
 Primitives include one or more qualifiers followed by an ID name or number.
 
 Qualifier    Description                                     Examples
 Type         Identifies what ID name or number refers to     host,net,port
 Dir          Specifies transfer direction to or from Type    src,dst
 Proto        Restricts match to particular protocol          ether, ip, tcp, udp, http, ftp
 
 
 |------Primitive-----|   |Primitive|
 dst host 192.168.0.10 && tcp port 80
 Q   Q         ID          Q   Q   ID
 
 This primitive alone is an expression which could capture destination traffic of IP 192.168.0.10 on port 80.
 
 
 Under normal circumstances a maximum frame on an Ethernet connection is 1518 bytes. When ether, IP, TCP headers are removed 1460 bytes are left for a layer 7 header and/or data.
 
Ethernet header is 14 bytesplus a 4 byte CRC.
IP header is minimum 20 bytes.
TCP header is minimum 20 with no data or options included.
TCP with SYN , ACK, RST, FIN around 54 bytes.
