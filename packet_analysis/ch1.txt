Packet analysis uses network card to read all traffic not just traffic addressed to yourself.
Commercial vs OS packet sniffers vary in terms of non-traditional or newer protocols being recognized. Commercial tend to have better reporting while OS features can be built upon and shared with community. [Wireshark, Omnidumo] GUI while tcpdump more advanced yet CLI

OSI 7 Layer Model:

    Name          Format
1.  Physical      Bits
2.  Data Link     Frames
3.  Network       <---where Packets reside
4.  Transport     Segments
5.  Session       Data
6.  Presentation  Data
7.  Application   Data

1.  Medium used as foundation to faciliate transfer. Wired or Wireless. 
2.  Transports data across the physical layer. Provides schema to identify devices via MAC addresses etc. 
    Bridges/switches live in this layer.
3.  Responsible for routing between physical devices. Layer is responsible for logical addressing through IP addresses and breaking data segments into packets. 
    Routers live in this layer.
4.  Provides reliable transportation services through TCP(connection-based), UDP(connectionless) etc. Error detection/correction occur at this level.
    Firewalls and proxy servers can exist on this level.
5.  Initates and ends communication between devices gracefully(usually).
6.  Transforms data into application-readable format. Encoding/decoding and encryption/decryption occur on this plane.
7.  Surface layer seen and used by layer displayed by UI for a preferably good UX.
